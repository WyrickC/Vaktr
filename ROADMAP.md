# Vaktr Roadmap

## Current Version: v1

## Planned

### CPU Temperature Monitoring
CPU temperature sensors on AMD and Intel require kernel-level access (PCI config space / MSR registers) that Windows restricts to signed kernel drivers. Every monitoring app that shows CPU temps (HWiNFO, Core Temp, MSI Afterburner) ships a signed driver for this.

LibreHardwareMonitor supports CPU temps through the [PawnIO](https://pawnio.eu/) kernel driver. The plan is to bundle PawnIO into the Vaktr installer so CPU temperatures work out of the box with no extra setup.

**Status:** GPU temps work today. CPU temp panel exists in the UI — just needs the driver bundled.

### Panel Resizing
Allow users to resize panels between standard (1x1), wide (2x1), and tall (1x2) sizes. Panel sizes would persist across sessions just like panel positions do today.

**Status:** Architecture designed, implementation deferred to a future release.

### Notifications & Alerts
Toast notifications when metrics cross configurable thresholds — e.g., CPU > 90%, memory > 85%, drive > 95% full. Gives you passive monitoring without keeping the window open.

**Status:** Planned.

### Data Export
Export historical metric data as CSV or JSON for analysis in external tools. Useful for post-incident investigation, capacity planning, or just curiosity.

**Status:** Planned.

### Prometheus Metrics Endpoint
Expose Vaktr's collected metrics via a local HTTP endpoint in Prometheus exposition format. This lets advanced users scrape Vaktr from a Prometheus instance for long-term storage, alerting, or multi-machine dashboards — bridging the gap between Vaktr's simplicity and Prometheus/Grafana's power.

**Status:** Planned.
